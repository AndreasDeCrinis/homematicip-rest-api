# homematicip-samples
A collection of samples and simple scripts for the homematicip rest api wrapper

##PULL Requests##
Use the SampleTemplate folder as a base for your requests. 
The script must work.
Also modify this Readme.md to add a short summary of your Project.

If you aren't using Visual Studio you can skip the *.pyproj file. I will add it in an additional commit.

## SampleTemplate ##
This sample will just display the current AP Version.
The usage for this folder is intended as a template for other examples


##CheckPresenceOnPing##
This script will ping (ICMP) all configured IP addresses (e.g. mobile phones which are connected over WiFi). If no device answers the ping, it will activate the security zones
